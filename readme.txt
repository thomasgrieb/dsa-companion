    - Input custom modifier for a throw (situational bonus/malus granted by real life game master)
    - Colour coded crits
    - Display characters skill value if present
    - Fit view to "skill value present" and "no skill value present" states and highlight most important numbers in either case
- Character information window (overview)
- Ability to delete profiles (in character info window?) and limit saved profiles to 10
- Extend the name checking during character creation by a filename check in order to prevent file overwrites
- Redesign for prettier/better view
- Statistics window
- Ability to display skill information during roll and separately as "wiki" (copyright issues?)
- Turn profile/character creation into multi-stage process (name -> attributes -> skills -> confirm) and enable seperate editing of existing characters?

- Custom app design
- Language switcher and english localization
- Light and dark modes
- Dice animations (+switch for deactivating them)
