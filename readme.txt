- Ability to delete profiles (in character info window?) and limit saved profiles to 10
- Extend the name checking during character creation by a filename check in order to prevent file overwrites
- Statistics window
- Turn profile/character creation into multi-stage process (name -> attributes -> skills -> confirm) and enable seperate editing of existing characters?
- Support for Optolith files?
- Custom app design
- Language switcher and english localization
- Light and dark modes
- Dice animations (+switch for deactivating them)
